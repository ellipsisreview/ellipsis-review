    <blockquote>It is said that, as Jacques de Molay, the last Grandmaster of the Knights Templar, burnt at the stake, he cursed Pope Clement V and King Philip IV and demanded that they answer to God for their crimes. Within the month, Pope Clement met his maker. Seven months later, Philip IV did the same.</blockquote>
<div class="writings">
<p>&emsp;Friday the 13th is a day that has become an irrevocable staple in the Western tradition of superstition. Some say the source of this malignant connotation was the infamous destruction of the Christian Knights Templar, a monastic order of warriors which was established to defend pilgrims visiting the Holy Land which had just been won in the Crusades. The Templars, at the height of their power in the 13th century, held properties as far west as England and as far east as Jerusalem, and began to operate a secure and effective banking system that was trusted by kings and Jerusalem-bound pilgrims alike (“Templars”). But on the morning of Friday, October 13, in 1307, the French Knights Templar were arrested, and seven years after Friday the 13th, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, was burnt at the stake, leaving the order destined to reign in the realm of legend and obscurity (Jones). How did such an affluent and powerful organization come to its demise? The source of their downfall comes from a human phenomenon that has been affecting society for millennia: rumor. It was this force that served as the foil of the organization when King Philip IV of France plotted to profit from their demise, with the Knights failing to realize how vulnerable they were to scandal. The case of the Knights Templar serves as a poignant reminder of the danger of rumor and can act as a guide for those in the 21st century as rumor becomes more ubiquitous with the advent of the Internet. But it is best to begin by understanding the nature of rumor before examining how this social force reduced a military force to the pages of history books.</p>
<p>&emsp;The power of rumor and its fundamental role in human interaction is undeniable. Because of rumor’s potential to smear innocent parties with libel, religious moral codes have long condemned the practice (Singal). But modern scholarship has shown that it is rumor that allowed for sophisticated human language to develop in the first place, an innovation which would secure humanity’s place at the top of the food chain (Harari 22-24). Jesse Singal explains that groups were more evolutionarily viable if members of the group kept track of their leader’s behavior via rumor. This primitive form of accountability has influenced humanity to pay attention to rumors about high-status individuals and organizations. It is this “accountability” facet of rumors that give them the power to make or break a political campaign. But despite the evolutionary advantage that this form of rumor has given, accountability rumors can still go terribly awry. The potential for rumor’s misuse is linked to one of its characteristics. According to Singal, rumor is used as an avenue towards truth when little information is available. While rumor can provide a community with information, the lack of information makes it more difficult to ensure that rumors are factually sound. Other characteristics of rumor do little in establishing it as a reliable form of communication. Rumor is often spread verbally, a characteristic that makes it vulnerable to distortion, according to Robert Knapp’s “A Psychology of Rumor” (22). This characteristic of rumor leaves it open to becoming a form of propaganda. Knapp also described how rumor connected to a community’s emotions (23). It appears that rumors are like entities that endure a form of natural selection: the potential for a rumor to express or gratify a community’s emotional needs serves as rumor’s evolutionary viability. The different ways in which a rumor can connect to a community’s emotions were classified by Knapp as follows.</p>
<p>&emsp;Knapp placed rumors into three categories: the wishful, the pessimistic, and the aggressive (23-24). The wishful rumors, which Knapp also referred to as “pipe-dream” rumors, are those that express the hopes of a community. Examples drawn from American society during World War II include “The Japanese do not have enough oil to last six months” (Knapp 24). According to Knapp, pessimistic or “bogie” rumors are the opposite of wishful thinking, finding their source in a community’s anxieties. Wartime examples included rumors of mass destruction and excessive casualties. Where pessimistic rumors come from fear, aggressive rumors come from anger, and are usually directed against neighbors and allies. These included the racial rumors that discredit the morality of others based on their race. From each of these examples, it is seen that this method of communication, described by Singal as a “vehicle to get to the truth”, is often clouded by emotions and prejudice, making it an unreliable vehicle at best. Indeed, rumor’s emotional characteristic, coupled with its verbal distortions and the necessary information-starved environment, has made it the ideal vehicle for propaganda (Knapp 1). It is this potential for rumors’ use as propaganda that gave Philip IV the opportunity to use them against the Knights Templar.</p>
<p>&emsp;When the historical context of the Knights Templar is examined, modern insights into rumor reveal how vulnerable the Knights were to rumor. The Knights Templar had evolved from a simple monastic order that defended pilgrims to a widespread military organization with an intricate banking system.  According to Malcolm Barber, a leading expert on the Knights Templar, the Knights Templar had grown to need specialists in law, accounting, and homiletics. Eventually, the order saw a need to convince the rest of Christendom of their validity to justify the wealth that the Templar had accumulated (Barber). The Knights Templar began to build a reputation for saintly courage and integrity, which eventually captured the imaginations of medieval chroniclers and their readers (Barber). The valiant reputation of the Templar was such that their fighters were praised more often for their actions in battle than competing military orders, even when all parties demonstrated equal amounts of bravery (Brodman). Moreover, the Knights Templar had begun to find strong allies in the other European monarchs, from the King of England to the kings of the Iberian Peninsula (Robinson 423-424). As Singal and Harari have shown, rumor evolved to give high status individuals and organizations scrutinous attention. Thus, while the group’s political and cultural prominence gave Philip IV a challenge, it also provided the medieval rumormonger with excellent tinder to light a blazing rumor of scandal. Philip IV’s task would be easier given the rumors that were already being spread regarding the Templars. Despite the valiant reputation of the Knights, territorial losses in the Holy Land in the 13th century forced the organization to face rumors of inefficient use of funds, drunken revelry, and quarreling with other military orders, which were all taken to be the causes for Christendom’s losses in the East (Nicholson). </p>
<p>&emsp;Another factor in the situation that gave Philip IV more fuel for his rumors was the secrecy of the organization. With discretion that went so far as to keep the rules of the order away from public eyes, rumors were already circulating of medieval “street justice”, wherein those who threatened to expose the Templar were murdered or threatened into silence (Robinson 427). As Singal had pointed out, rumor is the vehicle for ascertaining truth in the absence of information, and the mystery surrounding the Knights Templar made rumor the optimal mode of communication. Moreover, the difficulty in verifying rumors made in the absence of information suited Philip IV quite well. Thus, at the turn of the 14th century, the stage was set when Philip IV, drowning in a financial quagmire of bills, began searching for a solution to his problems. The proverbial Templar wealth left Philip IV hoping that the riches seized from the Templar properties would be enough to satisfy his debts (Robinson 425). But he could only access the Templar coffers if the order became obsolete and its knights were jailed. </p>
<p>&emsp;Philip IV had already planned the logistics for arresting the Templars when he sent out orders to arrest all the Jews in France in 1306, in what Robinson described as a “dress rehearsal” (425). Philip IV knew the Jews were an easy target who would have few defenders. After arresting the Jews, Philip IV was able to confiscate their property and auction it off to the benefit of the crown’s coffers. Philip IV now knew that taking the Templars down was possible: but Templars’ reputation and status as defenders of the Christian faith would make the process more complicated. But Philip IV knew that despite the glowing reputation of the Templars, the organization was not free from bad press. As previously mentioned, the Knights were already facing charges of excessive carousing and divisive rivalry with other Christian military orders like the Hospitallers. Following the Crusaders’ military defeat in Acre in 1291, Europe began to see the Knights Templar as a once noble and courageous military order that had descended to greed and corruption (Nicholson). Philip IV knew that declining public perception of the Knights could be used in his plan to destroy the military order. But these rumors alone could not give Philip IV all the justification he needed, for the Templars were not alone in their financial malpractices among other ecclesiastical orders, and a military failure hardly justified persecution. But rumors that tapped into the fears of Christian medieval Europe: that could be the climactic nail in the Templar coffin. And luckily for Philip IV, the Holy Roman and Universal Inquisition was underway. An accusation of heresy was all, and the Inquisition would make sure the order was dissolved. To make Philip luckier, an accusation of heresy would be very easy to fabricate. </p>
<p>&emsp;It can be seen how pessimistic, anxiety-driven rumor served as the vehicle for Philip IV’s propaganda against the Knights Templar. As previously noted, pessimistic rumors serve as a barometer for a community’s fears and anxieties, and Christian medieval Europe had a deep fear of heresy. Michael Barbezat, writing for the Journal of the History of Sexuality, describes the roots of medieval anxiety and how they influenced Philip IV’s rumors about the Knights Templar. According to Barbezat, Philip IV of France regularly charged his opponents with devil worship and sodomy. Even the pope was not immune to this kind of attack. In the case of the Templar, the rumors included accusations of worshipping the devil in the form of a cat and initiating members with institutionalized homosexual acts (Robinson 432). Barbezat links this kind of libel to the Christian conception of the church as the body of Christ. Barbezat shows that as medieval Europe was building allegorical examples of the body of Christ with Noah’s Ark and Augustine’s City of God, there was an implicit inverse idea that was beginning to form: a body of carnal sinners. Just as the sacrament of communion brought the body of Christ together, Barbezat argues that heretics would often be accused of devilish rituals that also had an implication of bringing the devilish body together, which was the case with the Templar. This culminated in the sexual nature of the attacks on the order: just as the sacrament of marriage brought man and woman together into one flesh with its subsequent consummation in sex, the allegation could be made that the initiation of a knight into the order brought him into one flesh with its members, resulting in homosexual consummation. Barbezat begins to show how medieval Christendom feared perversions of Christian doctrines and rules. Barbezat’s research into the medieval cultural milieu coupled with Knopp’s insights into rumor lead to the conclusion that it was this fear of perversion of the Christian faith that created the opportunity to spread a bogie rumor that led to the Templar’s demise. </p>
<p>&emsp;John Robinson describes how Philip IV began to put his ideas into action in the work Dungeon, Fire, and Sword. According to Robinson, Philip IV’s plan for beginning the false rumor solidified when Italian criminal informer Arnolfo Deghi brought the French crown into contact with a bitter ex-Templar, Esquiu de Florian. Philip IV and one of his advisors, William de Nogaret, sent Deghi and de Florian to a remote prison. Deghi and de Florian asked for a priest to confess to, but there was no priest available, according to plan. By using the rule that allowed for a Catholic to hear another layman’s confession, de Florian began to confess to Deghi of numerous sins that he had committed as a member of the Knights Templar, from sodomy to heresy. Arnolfo Deghi, under an alias, immediately answered that these allegations needed to be brought directly to the crown, and the prison officials who were working with the crown brought the information to the royal court. The king now had an accusation that could pass as being authentic. This set the stage for the fateful events on Friday the 13th. When the people found out about the mass arrest of the Knights Templar, the accusations were circulated in letters of condemnation which Don Jones, writing for Time, likened to a medieval Twitterstorm. The baseless accusations were repeated enough that an ecclesiastical council found the Templar name so soiled that its dissolution would be best, leaving Philip IV with the Templar wealth. </p>
<p>&emsp;Seven hundred years after the fall of the Knights Templar, the Vatican found documents that showed Pope Clement V’s original judgment of innocence regarding the order, which Philip IV quickly censured (Cristofaro and Wilkinson). But the rumors against the Templars have been so effective that even now, some historians assume the Templar’s corruption to be fact (Skoda). It is this enduring effect of Philip IV’s libelous rumor that demonstrates the danger of this medium of information. Dan Jones makes a similar case in his article on the Templars for Time. In recent years, “fake news” and “post-truth” have become cultural buzzwords. Those in modern society like to think that fake news is a recent phenomenon, but, as it is in the obvious case of the Knights Templar, fake news has plagued civilization for centuries. Rumor is important for disseminating information: Knapp and Singal make that clear. But rumor is a vehicle for information that is vulnerable to being hijacked by misinformation rooted in fear and prejudice. The Knights Templar show how rumor can even upend due process. It is necessary to realize that rumor can be a destructive force that feeds on society’s fears and anxieties. Thus, when rumors are observed, the root causes, those fears and anxieties, must be addressed. If they are not, those rumors could quickly have real world consequences. It is said that, as Jacques de Molay, the last Grandmaster of the Knights Templar, burnt at the stake, he cursed Pope Clement V and King Philip IV and demanded that they answer to God for their crimes. Within the month, Pope Clement met his maker. Seven months later, Philip IV did the same (Robinson 468). In the case of the Templars, perhaps divine justice found its consummation. But humans should strive to provide justice in this life as well. Making the consequences of ill-founded rumor clear and addressing rumors that begin to abound with transparency could be a step in the right direction. </p>
