    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Never has a more cryptic novel been written than Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. The novel described the world under a new world order, where the globalist society, the World State, micromanaged its populace. This civilization is juxtaposed with the primitive state of the Savage Reservation, the final remaining religious society. The two civilizations appear to mirror an interesting dichotomy embedded in society itself, that between faith and reason. But what was Huxley’s intention in writing his novel? The answer is revealed as, out of the tension of faith and reason, the character of John Savage, of the Savage Reservation, emerges. It is John that bridges the divide between the poles of faith and reason that are represented by the Savage Reservations and the civilized world.
</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The description of the reasonable civilization of the novel opens with a “hatchery” in London. It was here that babies were created: eggs mechanically fertilized, the resulting children conditioned to fit seamlessly into the collective. The ways in which the children were conditioned, however, were inordinately cruel. For example, in a process described in the novel as “Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning,” nurses would set open books and flowers in front of infants. Once the infants examined the objects, alarms would sound, and an electric shock would be delivered. The aim of the exercise? That “‘They’ll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an ‘instinctive’ hatred of books and flowers. . . They’ll be safe from books and botany all their lives.” (Huxley, 14) Mustapha Mond, a World Controller (i.e., one who manages society) justified the conditioning to the students, saying, “‘In the end. . . the Controllers realized that force was no good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopædia. . . ’” (34) Mond explained that rational science is most effective in creating a stable civilization. Yet it was science that resulted in the inhumane conditioning described earlier in the novel. Ultimately, Huxley found that reason alone could only lead to material progress. Reason alone couldn’t lead to moral virtue in a society.

Reason alone couldn’t lead to moral virtue in a society. 
</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;It was with this in mind that Huxley explored the world of the Savage Reservation. The state of life in the Reservation was primitive. The population was impoverished, completely deprived of scholarship, and the benefits thereof. Hence, they were left to their alien rituals, wherein, during one of them, “a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and holding in his hand a whip of plaited leather, advanced towards him (a boy). The boy moved on as though unaware of the other’s existence. The coyote-man raised his whip; there was a long moment of expectancy, then a swift movement, the whistle of the lash and its loud fast-sounding impact on the flesh. The boy’s body quivered.” (Huxley, 77) It is at this moment that Huxley also critiques pure faith. Having concluded that a reason-based society will lack moral progress, Huxley further concludes that a faith-based society will lack both moral and material progress. But if both reason- and faith-based societies fail, by what basis may a society succeed?
</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;While Huxley does not answer this question on a societal level, one may surmise his answer via the character of John. John, born of parents from the World State, was brought up in a Savage Reservation (his mother being stranded in the desolate landscape). It was here, in the fold of religion, that John found moral virtues. But his moral virtues were supported by a literary source: a volume of the collected works of Shakespeare. Huxley describes John’s first encounter with Shakespeare as a transcendent one, describing John’s thoughts after reading but a few lines, writing, “The strange words rolled through his mind. . . like old Mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone. . . but better than Mitsima’s magic, because it meant more, because it talked to him.” (Huxley, 88) It was through Shakespeare that John was able to rise above the superstition of the Savage Reservation. It was through a mix of religion and reason that John became the hero of Brave New World. Unlike the secular World State, John had a conception of virtue. Despite being raised in a Savage Reservation, John was capable of understanding Shakespearean themes of love, intrigue, and guilt. 
</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;But why did Huxley not describe a third society, one which was built on a dual basis of transcendence and reason? Why did he answer that question on a personal plane, through the character of John? Likely, it’s because Huxley did not seek to change society through his novel: he merely hoped to transform the reader. He knew that society would always lean toward religious fanaticism or nihilistic rationale. But he hoped that he could tell his readers to be different, to walk the fine line between the two extremes. It is from walking this path that one may be a moral, reasonable person. Huxley held up John Savage as an example. 
</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;It is important that the reader reflects on Huxley’s message. In a world where culture is becoming increasingly radical in a secular or religious direction, the reader should remember that both extremes are dangerous. The reason-based World State conditioned infants in an evil manner, and thought it virtuous. The radically religious Savage Reservation, however, had faith in exchange for material prosperity. One should remember John, who had a foot in the physical realm and the other in the spiritual.
