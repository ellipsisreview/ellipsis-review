      <h4>Modernity's Need for Faith</h4>
      <p>The remedy found in Kierkegaard's "Fear and Trembling" for a dying culture</p>

    <blockquote>"Love, after all, has its priests in the poets, and occasionally one hears a voice that knows how to keep it in shape; but about faith one hears not a word, who speaks in <em>this</em> passion&rsquo;s praises?"</blockquote>
<div class="writings">
<p>In the advent of social media, a new phenomena has arisen: <em>cancel culture</em>, a digital composite of the mob that has existed since Socrates and Christ. Many live in fear of violating the ethics imposed by this culture, even if they think its ethics are compromised. In Kierkegaard&rsquo;s most famous work, &ldquo;Fear and Trembling&rdquo;, we find how faith is the solution to this spiritual impotence.</p>
<p>The highest virtue, according to Kierkegaard, is faith. But what does Kierkegaard mean by faith?</p>
<p>Kierkegaard uses the phrase &ldquo;teleological suspension of the ethical'' to describe his idea of faith. This phrase, like much of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s writing, is overwrought and needlessly complicated. To begin with, the root word for &ldquo;teleological&rdquo; means &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, which makes his dictum mean a<em> purpose-driven suspension of ethics</em>. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; also stands in need of clarification. The Soren Kierkegaard entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy tells us the meaning of ethics as it relates to our discussion: &ldquo;<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">&lsquo;ethics&rsquo; represents &lsquo;the universal&rsquo;, or more accurately the prevailing social norms. . . [which are] are used as reasons to make sense of, or justify, an action within a community.&rdquo; Hence, Kierkegaard&rsquo;s idea of faith is a </span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"><em>purpose-driven suspension of social norms</em></span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;">.</span></p>
<p>Kierkegaard uses the story of Abraham and Isaac to expound on his idea of faith. For the uninitiated, the story concerns God instructing Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. As Abraham, knife in hand, prepares to end his beloved son&rsquo;s life, an angel holds Abraham back, and a ram is offered instead. The story is horrifying, and Kierkegaard cannot trivialize it the way some churchgoers do: he must make sense of how Abraham, through this trial, becomes the &ldquo;father of faith&rdquo;. This is where his &ldquo;teleological suspension of the ethical&rdquo; arises.</p>
<p>How does one teleologically suspend the ethical? By submitting oneself to the authority of a higher power, as Abraham did. Even though Abraham had a social duty to care for his boy, he had a greater duty to God, to obey his command. Here we see how while social ethics are not always wrong, they are less respectable than the ethical duties that come from a relationship with God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We begin to see how it is possible, by faith, to have the backbone to withstand the wind of cancel culture that will separate the wheat from the chaff. And we also see why Kierkegaard lamented a modern culture cutting itself off from faith. A society without faith will lack meaning, and spines to boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith, then, is as needed today as it was three millennia ago when Abraham walked with Isaac up Mount Moriah. Walking in the path of Abraham will be disagreeable to society. Yet Kierkegaard is right when he says, &ldquo;to contend with the whole world is a comfort, but to contend with oneself dreadful&rdquo;. Indeed, the difficulty of worldly trials will merely inspire the faithful, for, as Kierkegaard tells us, &ldquo;noble natures are only inspired by difficulty&rdquo;.</p>
