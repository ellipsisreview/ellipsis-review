<div class="writings">
   <p>&emsp;I read this book six years ago, hating every second of it. It was my first foray into the world of refined literature, so I suppose it was only to be expected. But in spite of my initial distaste for this novel, there was one scene that, even today, I can recall vividly. Captain Wolf Larsen, furious at a crew member, sentences him to a cruel death. Humphrey van Weyden, our naive protagonist, begs Larsen to spare the crewmate’s life, arguing for the inherent value of human life. Larsen responds, “Life? Bah! Of cheap things it is the cheapest!” I was as shocked as van Weyden was to find such irreverence for life, including human life, partially because the philosophy is difficult to refute: life does seem, as Larsen puts it, to be “a ferment”, a mere yeast that squirms until it squirms no more. As the years passed, I kept returning to those words, particularly when I found a strong resemblance of Nietzsche’s “superman” in Wolf Larsen. This compelled me to revisit London’s work.</p>
<p>&emsp;The primary tension of the novel revolves around the contrast between van Weyden’s idealism and Larsen’s grim realism, a dichotomy that reminds one of the debate between Alyosha and Ivan Karamazov in Dostoevsky’s “The Brothers Karamazov”. Larsen is entrenched in the philosophy of existential nihilism, van Weyden in groundless idealism, and the debauchery and thoughtlessness of the crew serves as a middle ground. This archetypal struggle is heightened by the arrival of a woman lost at sea. It is with this development that the resolution of the struggle begins to take shape.</p>
<p>&emsp;Humphrey van Weyden does not descend to the debauchery of the sailors or the cruelty of Larsen because of the motivation to save a woman. It appears redemption of another leads to redemption from nihilism, or something worse. Ultimately, "The Sea-Wolf" is a book that features the prominent Western motif of redemption in sacrifice, an archetype that goes all the way back to the Son of God himself.</p>
<p>&emsp;With this work, London created an implicit call to action. Our hearts and minds tell us that Larsen’s nihilism is evil, the crewmates’ debauchery is empty, and van Weyden’s idealism is foolish. With this in mind, the only alternative is to sacrifice oneself for another, and to live life with the purpose of coming “to seek and to save that which was lost.”</p>
