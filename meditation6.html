      <h4>Modernity's Need for Faith</h4>
      <p>The remedy Kierkegaard has for a dying culture</p>

    <blockquote>"Love, after all, has its priests in the poets, and occasionally one hears a voice that knows how to keep it in shape; but about faith one hears not a word, who speaks in <em>this</em> passion&rsquo;s praises?"</blockquote>
<div class="writings">
<p>In the advent of social media, a new phenomena has arisen: <em>cancel culture</em>, a digital composite of the mob that has existed since Socrates and Christ. Many live in fear of violating the ethics of society, even if they think society&rsquo;s ethics are compromised. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s ubiquitous &ldquo;teleological suspension of the ethical&rdquo; is the solution to this spiritual impotence.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard postulates that the highest virtue is faith, and that faith is attained by transcending the ethics of the universal by putting oneself into direct relation with the absolute. In layman&rsquo;s terms, faith comes when we act in accordance with a direct relationship with God, regardless of the judgment of society.</p>
<p>The story of Abraham and Isaac is used by Kierkegaard to illustrate this principle: even though Abraham&rsquo;s calling to sacrifice his son is seen by society as barbaric, Abraham transcended the temporal considerations of the ethical and considered the direct command of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kierkegaard is quick to point out that not anyone can sacrifice his son virtuously, for they would have to <em>love</em> their child the way Abraham loved Isaac. Indeed, here we find the paradox of belief: Abraham believes he will receive Isaac because of God&rsquo;s promise that Isaac&rsquo;s seed would become the manifestation of the Abrahamic covenant, in spite of the physical impossibility of Isaac&rsquo;s survival in the event of Abraham&rsquo;s sacrificial act. Hence, Abraham, in spite of his love for his son, knew he could sacrifice him, because of the teleological suspension of the ethical in addition to the paradox of belief.</p>
<p>One of the deepest insights Kierkegaard has is the observation that &ldquo;to contend with the whole world is a comfort, but to contend with oneself dreadful&rdquo; (138). Abraham could contend with the whole world because he was at peace with himself, because he knew that this peace came from being aligned with God. As the apostle John wrote, &ldquo;perfect love casts out fear&rdquo;, and the apostle Paul: &ldquo;the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds&rdquo;. Being at peace with God means peace with oneself. Contention with the world means nothing then. Faith allows for the greatest courage.</p>
<p>What speaks to us now is Kierkegaard&rsquo;s lamentation of a rational society that has dismissed the value of faith, for in dismissing faith, which Kierkegaard regards to be the highest of human passions, humanity dismisses one of the greatest avenues of meaning.</p>
<p>To make his point clear, he reflects on the problem of boredom in modern society. Is the child who, after getting &ldquo;through all their games by noon&rdquo;, and asks &ldquo;impatiently, &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t anyone think of a new game?&rsquo;&rdquo; more &ldquo;developed and advanced than children of the same or a previous generation&rdquo;? Kierkegaard&rsquo;s answer is no. We, as children of modernity, have looked up from our pleasant amusements and asked &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t anyone think of a new game?&rdquo; Yet Kierkegaard makes his point clear:&nbsp; &ldquo;noble natures are only inspired by difficulty&rdquo;. He proceeds to tell us that, no matter how far we advance as a species, every generation has fresh work to do in the area of the authentic human factor: passion. And Kierkegaard argues that faith is the highest passion of all. To pursue and develop faith is a daunting, never-ending quest. He likens one living in faith to one who is in love: if the lover is asked if he is stationary in his love, he would adamantly deny the assertion, for he has his life in it. Likewise, one who lives in faith will constantly move forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kierkegaard teaches us that faith will give us courage and meaning as we put ourselves into a direct relationship with God, thereby transcending the judgment of man. To be clear: Kierkegaard never states that we are free from morality per se, free to float in an ocean of relativism. Rather, we are so tied to the absolute giver of morality that we will transcend the ephemerality of social ethics, and deal directly with the supreme being. Hence, faith indeed frees us from bondage, thereby giving us the courage to fight for our convictions that come from God.</p>
