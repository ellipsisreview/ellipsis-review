    <blockquote> McMurphy is the modern prophet, the modern Socrates, the modern Moses, the modern Christ.</blockquote>
<div class="writings">
    <p>&emsp;   It is interesting to note the degree to which chaos and order are involved in the dichotomies presented by this novel. From its themes on individual vs. society to humor vs. conformity, the manifestations of the two primordial forces are apparent.</p>
<p>&emsp;   McMurphy is the chaotic figure. Big Nurse Ratched is obviously overbearing, maternal order. The patients are stuck in the stifling comfort of Ratched’s psychiatric ward. McMurphy is the Christ who comes to buck the complacent system, who arrives to save the patients from being blinded by the order and comfort of the domestic habitat. McMurphy is the modern prophet, the modern Socrates, the modern Moses, the modern Christ. </p>
<p>&emsp;   How may we apply the truths of this novel? What of its insights? Let us begin with its chief insights. </p>
<p>&emsp;   Its chief insight is this: the order and comfort of society is not something to be comfortable with. Before you know it you will be engulfed in what the narrator Chief Bromden called “the fog”, that horrid comatose condition of complete complacency. You will become what the patients call the “rabbit”. </p>
<p>&emsp;    A word on the themes of emasculation in the novel: I am of the opinion that the author provided examples of how society can try to domesticate male tendencies, such as rough-housing or excessive humorous carousing. It is something we have seen throughout history, but particularly in today’s postmodern, “toxic masculinity” obsessed culture. In this way, Ken Kesey was a prophet in predicting the course of social mores.</p>
<p>&emsp;   There are two notable deaths in the falling action of this novel. First, Billy Babbit commits suicide because he is afraid of his overbearing mother. Second, after McMurphy is lobotomized, Chief Bromden performs a mercy killing. Two deaths. </p>
<p>&emsp;   The meaning of the first death is as follows. Billy Bibbit has been controlled by his overbearing mother for years. It is because of her that he is stuck in the mental institution. Maternal manifestations of society are prevalent: I believe that the author said with Billy Bibbit’s death that on ewould rather lie than face the lash of social retribution if one becomes too engulfed in order, losing the other half of the dichotomy, and thereby losing the big picture. After all, sometimes one must struggle with society to make one manifest. Freud wrote in “Civilization and Its Discontents” that “It was discovered that a person becomes neurotic because he cannot tolerate the amount of frustration which society imposes on him in the service of its cultural ideals”. It is our responsibility to be independent enough to function and not be dominated by society. However, McMurphy dies in a mercy-killing, due to the consequences of his punishment. </p>
<p>&emsp;   One must be independent enough to not be cowed, dominated, or dependent on society, but must be cooperative enough to not be beaten by the combine. </p>
