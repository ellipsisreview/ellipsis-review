<div class="writings">
   <p>Several months ago, I resolved to read Dostoevsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo; out of a desire to finish reading his four great novels (I still need to read &ldquo;Demons&rdquo;). The premise of the novel was of great interest to me: Dostoevsky&rsquo;s conception of the closest man could get to attaining &ldquo;the mark of Christ&rdquo; living in the filth of a corrupted world. But as I finished the novel, I was left rather unsatisfied. All of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works seem to have a tragic element, but where &ldquo;Crime and Punishment&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Brothers Karamazov&rdquo; both end with redemptive notes (Raskolnikov committing to Christianity in the former and Alyosha telling the children that innocent charity will save them from apathy in the latter), &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo; contains a melancholy close, wherein Western Europe&rsquo;s liberalizing influence on Russia is jarringly condemned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What one must consider is that every one of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s great novels attacks an idea: &ldquo;Demons&rdquo; attacked the nihilism of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s zeitgeist: &ldquo;Crime and Punishment&rdquo; was a polemic against the Nietzschean &ldquo;superman&rdquo; who would transcend traditional morality: and in &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo;, Dostoevsky&rsquo;s criticism is directed either at the Christian ideal and faith, or at the decadence of 19th century Russia. Perhaps &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo; concerns both. Ultimately, &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo; is a tragedy, but it discusses the danger of what I will call &ldquo;radical altruism&rdquo;. What follows is a summary of the portions of the novel relevant to my discourse and my interpretation of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Summary</p>
<p>The central focus of the novel is on Dostoevsky&rsquo;s conception of the most &ldquo;perfectly beautiful man&rdquo;: Prince Myshkin, whose excessive Christian virtue earns him the moniker of &ldquo;idiot&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is expected that a novel like &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo; will be somewhat unfocused: many of the greatest works of the 19th century, like &ldquo;Les Miserables&rdquo; or Dostoevsky&rsquo;s own &ldquo;The Brothers Karamazov&rdquo;, suffer from this malaise, undoubtedly due to the pressures of serialization and lack of good editing. But &ldquo;The Idiot&rdquo; is a work that strives to earn the quality of &ldquo;tangential&rdquo;. There are countless side characters and plots that fail to weave together into a cohesive ending, which the narrator himself admits to when he writes &ldquo;Lebedev, Keller, Ganya, Ptitsyn, and many of the other persons of our story go on living as before and have changed but little. There is scarcely anything to be said about them&rdquo; (562). As such, the author of this humble meditation will not attempt to puzzle out the entire novel in all its unrelated scenes, but will focus on what eventually becomes the primary conflict of the novel: Myshkin and his choice between the beautiful but cruel Nastasya Filippovna, and the innocent but stubborn Aglaia Ivanovna.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myshkin meets both of these women in the first act of the novel. His first sighting of Nastasya is from a mere photograph, and his only knowledge of Nastasya&rsquo;s life, prior to meeting her, is that she&rsquo;s the vindictive mistress of a man named Totsky. Indeed, the reader learns that Nastasya has much reason to be vindictive, having been orphaned from a young age, and being raised by Totsky until she was of age, at which time she became his mistress. As a result, Nastasya feels irreparably dishonored, which causes her to be the cruel woman who enters Dostoevsky&rsquo;s drama. But Myshkin&rsquo;s &ldquo;beautiful soul&rdquo; sees past the veneer of apathy to the broken heart of Nastasya Filippovna. He is moved by charitable love to ask for Nastasya Filippovna&rsquo;s hand in marriage. While Nastasya Filippovna initially refuses, telling the prince that he&rsquo;d come to despise her, and that they&rsquo;d never be happy, she comes to accept his offer, but only to run away before the wedding for Rogozhin, her violent lover. Thus Myshkin commits himself to redeeming a woman who is uncertain if she wants to be redeemed or not.</p>
<p>Where Myshkin&rsquo;s love for Nastasya is largely redemptive and compassionate in character (what the Greeks would have called <em>agape</em>), his love for Aglaia Epanchin is, in the words of Dostoevsky scholar Joseph Frank, &ldquo;pure but carnal&rdquo;, what may be said to be a form of <em>eros</em>. Aglaia, the most beautiful of the four Epanchin daughters, falls in love with Myshkin&rsquo;s selfless nature. Myshkin appears to reciprocate these feelings, and confesses to his affections toward Aglaia. This is where the primary conflict arises.</p>
<p>While Myshkin would undoubtedly be happier with Aglaia, for that is where his passionate love would find fulfillment, he is compelled to suffer with Nastasya, for there his mission of compassion would be manifest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The climax occurs when Myshkin is forced to choose between Aglaia and Nastasya. Ultimately, <em>agape</em> finds victory over <em>eros</em>, but compassion hardly provides a silver lining. Nastasya leaves Myshkin at the altar, and the former is ultimately murdered by her spurned lover Rogozhin. Aglaia marries a Polish fraud and Myshkin goes insane.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Interpretation</p>
<p>The Idiot is about a Christ-man: the closest we could get to perfection. Yet this character, Myshkin, is taken advantage of and becomes insane. Is Dostoevsky saying that to imitate Christ is to fail? Does he wish us to live like Myshkin anyway?&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the main actions of the novel play out and we are left trying to resolve what we can, Yevgeny Pavlovich tells Myshkin what went wrong. The feeling Myshkin had for Nastasya was love, but a compassionate, pitying love. The feeling Myshkin had for Aglaia was love, in both a compassionate and romantic sense. Myshkin could have chosen Aglaia, but didn&rsquo;t. He understands so many people in the novel, but fails to understand Aglaia. Perhaps part of the problem is he values others so much he fails to value himself. Indeed, he fights for others, most notably Nastasya Filippovna, but he never lifts a finger for himself. This results in him failing to be with the woman he truly desires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the problem is that Myshkin is man, but not God. As I write this, I am tempted to say Christ&rsquo;s selflessness is not optimal for man, but that is heresy. Yet that is a logical conclusion, as it seems to me. Dostoevsky, however, wouldn&rsquo;t settle for such a conclusion, in my estimation. Perhaps he wants us to be like Christ even if we must sacrifice. Even if we&rsquo;re perfect, life will be hard. We mustn&rsquo;t give up in the face of hardship.</p>
<p>Yet it is still difficult to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ultimate answer is Myshkin is not Christ: he is a human attempt. An attempt that is all too human, and having erred, provides ample room for growth. Us, as flawed creatures too, may take these errors into account for our growth.</p>
<p>Myshkin&rsquo;s fundamental flaw is radical altruism. Perhaps this sounds wrong, but consider the definition of altruism: &ldquo;the fact of caring about the needs and happiness of other people and being willing to do things to help them, even if it brings no advantage to yourself&rdquo;. While altruism is indeed a good and noble sentiment, morality determines that the whining child deserves rebuke, and the murderer death, regardless of the feelings of the child or the well-being of the murderer. &ldquo;God is love&rdquo;. God is also justice. We are called to be like Christ, who was God in flesh. Hence we are called to love, because &ldquo;God is love&rdquo;. It is also necessary to be just, for God is indeed justice: to be wise, for God is wisdom. Indeed Myshkin possesses the virtues of wisdom, and has a sense of what is just: but he fails to apply these principles in his living.</p>
<p>Consider now the circumstances of Myshkin. The feeling Myshkin had for Nastasya was love, but a compassionate, pitying love, <em>agape</em>. The feeling Myshkin had for Aglaia was love, in both a compassionate and romantic sense (<em>eros</em>). Myshkin&rsquo;s love for the former is commendable, but it is only charitable. Charity is an inestimable good: but how can you realistically build a relationship out of pity? Myshkin&rsquo;s love for the latter is good, and it provides fertile ground for a fruitful relationship. Myshkin could have chosen Aglaia, the fertile soil, but didn&rsquo;t. Perhaps part of the problem is he values others so much he fails to value himself. Indeed, he fights for others, most notably Nastasya Filippovna, but he never lifts a finger for himself. This results in him failing to be with the woman he truly desires, and in failing to be with the woman who he attempts to save, which leads to irreparable harm for all three. Had he respected himself and had reasonable love, he could see it would be more beneficial to reject Filippovna.</p>
<p>Myshkin succeeds spectacularly in forgetting himself and thinking of others: the question is if he is thinking of others properly. Myshkin empathizes with Nastasya Filippovna quite well, but in his empathy his mind is blinded from the glaring truth: the world has rendered her irredeemable, and a pledge of undying loyalty will not be what secures her soul from perdition. Indeed, his pledge to Nastasya renders him impotent in considering the happiness of Aglaia, in spite of his greater love for the latter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dostoevsky&rsquo;s conclusion regarding the conflict between radical altruism and radical self-interest appears to be a call for rational love. To love rationally is to love with the fullness of God: justice and wisdom will guide our love, which will give our love greater efficacy.</p>
