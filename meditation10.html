    <blockquote>At the root of this conflict is a question of individualism. Why should the individual be obedient if he can decide what to do for himself?</blockquote>
<div class="writings">
    <p>&emsp;When humanity’s ancient ancestors began to evolve into consciousness, other humans started to have greater value: instead of competitors, they could be fellow laborers. As this development was occurring, humans also began to band together as families, and according to Sigmund Freud, an early psychologist, fathers began to assert unchallenged authority (53-5). Freud goes on to say in his Civilization and Its Discontents that this proto civilization would soon evolve into fraternal orders, but this transition was only possible with disobedient sons rebelling against authoritarian fathers. While Freud’s ideas have become antiquated, his fundamental insight into the conflict between freedom and authority hint at this conflict’s deep roots. Freud believed that obedience was the way that society was born, but that rebellion was the path towards its evolution. This hints at the fundamental mutualistic relationship between the individual and society, and the necessity for both to give and take for the progression of civilization. But when does this obedience become dangerous? When one becomes obedient to the point of being unable to protest or effect change. </p>
<p>&emsp;Dystopian fiction has made the dangers of authoritarianism culturally ubiquitous, to the point of the Orwellian “thought police” becoming a cliché. But their ideas continue to hold value in illuminating the dangerous situation that unmitigated obedience leads to. Orwell’s 1984 is a window into a world where obedience is a prime virtue. In this world, children are encouraged to expose their parents if they toe outside the party line. If someone is too much of a free thinker, they will be reeducated. Likewise, Huxley’s Brave New World illustrates the danger of excessive authority and subsequent obedience. Huxley described a world order that materially could be described as utopia, but that stifled originality and made it impossible for thinking and reflection to occur. Huxley described the result as an exchange of high culture for mindless stability, and happiness for truth (150-4). What is shocking about these dystopian fictions is how the oppressed people fail to recognize their oppression and are even content to be in a state of slavery. Indeed, before the dystopian genre was even invented, writers were reflecting on the desire humanity has for authoritarianism, with Dostoevsky describing this phenomenon in The Brothers Karamazov, in the haunting chapter “The Grand Inquisitor” (328-53). Dostoevsky writes a fable in which Christ is again manifest in the world, this time in a Catholic village in the 1500s. Christ is at first greeted with adoration and exaltation, but is quickly apprehended by a cardinal, who is the Grand Inquisitor. The Grand Inquisitor, referencing his biblical temptations, tells Christ that he was wrong to deny the Devil’s suggestion to turn the stones into bread, wrong to not jump from the top of the temple, and wrong to not accept control of all the kingdoms of the world. Because conceding to these temptations would mean the enslavement of man, the Grand Inquisitor could understand why Christ denied them. Yet the Grand Inquisitor says that nonetheless, Christ was wrong, because mankind earnestly desires the comfort of slavery, and rejects the cruelty of freedom. It is the Grand Inquisitor’s shocking statement that offers insight into mankind. A man can desire comfort, even if that comfort means stagnation and slavery. The dystopian writers reveal how this desire can be dangerous and can spell the end of a meaningful civilization. </p>
<p>&emsp;Psychologists like Erich Fromm agree with dystopian fiction’s conclusions. But Fromm takes it a step further: he argues that humanity cannot evolve without acts of disobedience. He argues this point by going back to the ancient mythical texts of the Greeks and the Hebrews. The Greeks believed that humanity was indebted to Prometheus’ disobedience in stealing fire from the gods and giving it to man. Likewise, the Hebrews believed that Adam and Eve’s act of disobedience is what made their eyes open, which is often interpreted psychologically as the evolution from primitive ape to conscious man. Fromm concludes that just as disobedience draws humanity onward, obedience has the potential to bring humanity to its end. He proves his point by looking to the two global superpowers at the time of his writing: the U.S.S.R. and the United States. According to Fromm, both superpowers encourage obedience. The only difference lies in the explicit enforcement of obedience from the U.S.S.R. and the subtlety of the United States.</p>
<p>&emsp;Fromm’s concerns have been supported experimentally. The Milgram experiments, conducted in 1961, assigned “teacher” roles to participants, who were then asked to teach “learners” word pairs. If the learners failed to demonstrate that they learned the word pair, the “teacher” participants would shock the learner, with increasing voltages. Because the learners were all confederates (insiders that are instructed on what to do prior to the experiment), the learners pretended not to know the word pair. The aim of the experiment was to observe how far the participants would go in following the instructions of the researcher who would be present next to the teacher, even as the learner protested he was in danger. By the end of the experiment, Milgram found that two-thirds of participants were willing to shock the learner up to 450 volts, which was the highest level. Milgram found that this was due to a psychological willingness to act when it is believed that an authority figure will be liable. It is this psychological phenomenon that allowed for the Nazi atrocities during World War II and allow one to have a greater appreciation for Fromm’s argument: obedience is dangerous. </p>
<p>&emsp;Obedience is dangerous enough to interfere with human perception, which can obscure the truth. Doris Lessing in “Group Minds” makes that case by discussing the psychological phenomenon of group stigmatization preventing the ascertainment of truth. Lessing does so by citing the numerous experiments that have investigated the herd mentality. These often involve a group of confederates who try to convince the only ignorant participants to believe something that is obviously false, like concluding that two wooden planks of different length are equal. This nearly always results in the minority conceding to the majority. Lessing tells his reader that everyone makes this concession at least once. If obedience can lead to losing an accurate perception of the world, is it not best to see it dispensed with altogether?</p>
<p>&emsp;When William Golding answered this question in his novel The Lord of the Flies, his answer was no, making it clear that obedience and submission to authority are equally necessary for the good of humanity. When a group of boys are stranded on a remote island, with no guiding authority, violence and fear take hold as “survival of the fittest” becomes the only guiding force for human activity. Golding’s novel shows how a complete lack of obedience results in a complete lack of civilization.  Indeed, “survival of the fittest” becomes the problem with strict libertarianism. Writers like Steinbeck and Dickens reveal the practical perils of industrialized economies without political checks and balances by showing their readers how a lack of government involvement can result in the exploitation of the weak and vulnerable. Without obedience to authority, the humanity is reduced to that primal Darwinian maxim.</p>
<p>&emsp;At the root of this conflict is a question of individualism. Why should the individual be obedient if he can decide what to do for himself? This is the very libertarian strain that runs through this debate. It is related to Lessing’s conclusion that obedience to the group can result in the distortion of truth. The problem with this exaltation of individualism is laid out by Jonathan Haidt in his book The Righteous Mind. According to Haidt, humans are easily blinded to the truth, due to emotional and instinctive factors (106-7). Because of the power of confirmation bias (making information support one’s beliefs), Haidt likens an individual to a neuron. A neuron is useless on its own, but when it becomes one of many, it helps form a cognitive machine. Likewise, an individual is not likely to find truth alone: but coupled with the contributions of others, truth may be more easily discerned. Unfortunately, it becomes clear that humans need to be part of a larger collective to make meaningful progress. Haidt proves his point by looking to the scientific method and its goal: scientific consensus, the general agreement of scientists regarding a theory. Scientific consensus is one of the most important factors in finding truth, and it only happens when cooperation within humanity occurs. Cooperation and its benefits require obedience.</p>
<p>&emsp;Indeed, many have recognized that the pendulum can swing too far from the Orwellian extremes of groupthink. In an article for the New York Times, David Brooks discusses America’s “followship problem”. Brooks claims that the source of this problem is the West’s failure to recognize legitimate power and submit to sound authority because of its overreaction to authoritarianism. According to Brooks, the West cannot differentiate between legitimate power and corrupt power. What is interesting about Brooks’ article is that he postulates the existence of sound authority. It is here that a resolution to the conflict between obedience and authority begins to emerge. </p>
<p>&emsp;There is such a thing as sound authority. It is one of the grounding principles of the idea of the social contract, which in turn serves as the bedrock for American political philosophy. Hobbes, in his Leviathan, calls the commonwealth an “artificial man” with its “artificial chains” being the civil laws that attempt attain peace (149). This contrast between the chains of civil law and the result of peace is key. To live socially, peace is highly desirable for humanity, but it can only be attained with authority and subsequent obedience. Just as it has been established that freedom is needed for a healthy humanity, it has also been established that obedience is needed for the health of humanity. This leads to an ancient principle that comes from Aristotle: the doctrine of the mean. In Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, he tells his audience that one who is timid to the point of inaction is a coward, and one who has no fear at all becomes foolhardy, but a balance exists between the two that is called courage (34). Where Aristotle applied this logic to morality, one can also apply it to politics. The two extremes are authoritarianism and anarchy. The healthy mean, then, is a relationship between citizen and state in which both are accountable to each other: obedience with the room for change.   </p>
<p>&emsp;Obedience and authority are necessary for the structure of society. Without these forces, society is prone to lapse into a world of anarchy and disarray, as Golding shows in his writings. If the individual is lifted above the collective too much, the capabilities of the individual without the collective are overestimated. But it’s undeniable that a certain level of disobedience and individuality is necessary for the progress of mankind. Otherwise, humanity will be stuck in the dystopian worlds of Orwell and Huxley. A failure to be a unique individual will be a failure to contribute unique insights to a community. As Aristotle concluded long ago, the answer lies in the mean between extremes: obedience to authority with a healthy amount of cynicism that can serve to spur disobedience for the purpose of obedience to a higher power. It is with this balance that humanity can simultaneously preserve what is good but press on towards making things better.</p>
